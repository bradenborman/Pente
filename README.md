Pente is a strategy game. Players place glass markers on a grid. The object of the game is to get five of your own markers in a row or capture five pairs of your opponent's pieces. The first to do either wins.

Capturing takes place when exactly two pieces are sandwiched between pieces of the opposite color. 

Such as =>    x o o x    The x's surround the o's
